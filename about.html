<h2>Weather App</h2>
<p>Weather App is a weather forecasting web based app which allows users to see conditions, forecast, temperature, and other related metrics of the current location, as well as a number of other cities. </p>
<p>In home page, it includes a button named 'Save Data' which stores the current data like time, date, city name, temperature, humidity, pressure, etc. of current location in the database when pressed. And the stored data can be previewed in the tab named 'Historical Data'. This data are used by experts to predict the upcoming weather conditions.</p>
<p>Locations can be added or removed by entering the 'Search City' tab then pressing the search field in the top right corner of the application, which allows the user to type in the city's name. For each city, the app will display the current, highest, and lowest temperatures, UV index, time of sunrise and sunset, time of moonrise and moonset, current wind direction and speed, current humidity, outdoor visibility range, and barometric pressure. 
<p>The app also display an air quality report of current location. And some of the terms are described below.</p>
<h2>Weather forecasting</h2>
<p>Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions
of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the
weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts
are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere, land,
and ocean and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given
place.

<h2>API</h2>
<p>API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software
intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. An API is software that
can be used by other software to communicate with other software even hardware It acts
as a bridge between different software and devices.
When we use an application on our mobile phone, the application connects to the
Internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it,
performs the necessary actions, and sends it back to our phone. The application then
interprets that data and presents us with the information we wanted in a readable way.
This is what an API is and all of this happens via API.</p>
<h2>Weather API</h2>
<p>A weather API is an Application Programming Interface that allows weather data to be
queried from scripts and code. Good weather APIs provide both historical weather data
and forecast data via an easy-to-use, well-defined programming interface. The best APIs
have dozens of weather measures, near-real-time current conditions reporting,
and decades of worldwide historical weather reports. Ideally, both historical and forecast
look-ups would be combined into the same API entry point with the addition of an ultra-
long-range forecast based on climate statistics.</p>
